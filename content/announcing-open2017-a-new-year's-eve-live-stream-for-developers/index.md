Here are a few reasons to stay home this New Yearâ€™s Eve:

-   Itâ€™s the worst day of the year for [fatal drunk driving deaths](http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/jan-1-is-worst-day-for-drunken-driving-analysis-shows/)
-   Itâ€™s crowded
-   Itâ€™s freaking cold

And most importantly, if you go out, youâ€™ll miss #Open2017.

#Open2017 is a 4-hour interactive live streamâ€Šâ€”â€Šfor developers, by developers.

Weâ€™ll get started one hour before the ball drops in New York City, then continue streaming until midnight in San Francisco.

Thatâ€™s rightâ€Šâ€”â€Šweâ€™re going to ring in the new year 4 timesâ€Šâ€”â€Šeach time with exciting new guests:
