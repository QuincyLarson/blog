Free Code Camp actually only has 3 staff:

-   Berkeley Martinez oversees DevOps, security, and platform development
-   Michael Johnson manages volunteer developers and designers building tools for nonprofits
-   I run curriculum development, support, and social media

Everything else is done by volunteers within our community.

  

-   Leaders of 1,500+ study groups
-   Chat room moderators
-   Forum moderators
-   GitHub issue moderators
-   GitHub contributors
-   Experienced developers serving as mentors in our help chat rooms
-   Instructional designers expanding our curriculum
-   Visual designers dreaming up creative-commons assets
-   Contributors to this Medium publication

  

  

  

Our core platform is one of the most active repositories on GitHub

Free Code Camp’s core platform is just one locus of our community.

Here are some other ways 

This isn’t an unpaid internship. There is no promise of a job at the end of this. People are doing it because they care about our community and enjoy helping make it better.

Contributing to Free Code Camp is a ladder toward a career.

How free code camp approaches volunteerism:  
\- drive home our philosophy on volunteerism.   
\- high skilled people to contribute scarce time.   
\- edify the volunteer in the best light possible: extremely busy, have abilities that can make huge impacts, a volunteer drive organization functions this way:. Asyncronous channels.   
\- These aren’t internships with a tease that you might hire people. (There’s no such thing as a unpaid internship).   
\- Highlight the people who have contributed to free code camp who have gotten great jobs. Springboard to the creme of the crop jobs.  
\- no deadlines  
\- no in-person meetings  
\- We started with 1-hour, then 30 mins, then asynchronously  
\- the more you put in writing the better. Putting things in writing encourages responsibility.  
\- assigning people to tasks or letting them self- assign gives a clear ownership of work  
\- understanding who’s blocked at a given point in time makes it easier

There are some things volunteers shouldn’t be burdened with:  
\- answering support emails  
\- managing people  
\- modifying records in a production databases (only two people have access to our production database, and neither of them are volunteers)
