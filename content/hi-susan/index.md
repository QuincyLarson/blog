Hi [Susan](https://medium.com/u/52bbcc6e943f),

Thanks for your kind words.

I’m a firm believe in the old saying: “the only stupid question is the question you didn’t ask.” :)

As far as I know, there’s no way your device can be infected by malware just by opening up an email. You would need to click on the attachment. So if an email is suspicious — specifically if it comes from a strange email address like goog1e (with a 1 instead of an “l” for example) you should avoid opening any attachments.
