Here are three links worth your time:

1.  How a robot got Super Mario 64 and Portal “running” on an Super Nintendo from 1990 ([6 minute read](http://bit.ly/2jV5g7o))
2.  The concept of “caching” explained in 1 minute with pictures ([1 minute read](https://cachingexplained.com/))
3.  NHTSA’s full final investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot shows a 40% crash rate reduction ([1 minute read](http://tcrn.ch/2iJLYVH))
