### Thought of the day:

“Chess is historically a very balanced game that is entirely up to the skill of the player. This is great if you want to see who is better at chess but not so good if you’re trying to play a fun game with your friends of varying skill levels.” — Zach Gage, creator of [Really Bad Chess](http://reallybadchess.com/)

### Funny of the day:

My car finally made it home!

OK, in case you didn’t get this one, let me explain: 127.0.0.1 is “localhost” on a computer. Wherever you are, it will be your “home” IP address.

Happy coding!
