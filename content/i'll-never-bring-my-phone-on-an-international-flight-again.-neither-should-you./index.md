Here are three links worth your time:

1.  I’ll never bring my phone on an international flight again. Neither should you. ([7 minute read](http://bit.ly/2kPxOBI))
2.  “I literally want to hack my heart. But I can’t.” Interviews from the floor of OSCON, the biggest open source convention ([78 minute listen](http://bit.ly/2lghPgv))
3.  Watch Ewa build a GitHub Battle app on the latest episode of her video blog ([10 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2ktw3Xs))
