If the market eventually “wins” it will take years — maybe decades. And in the interim, consumers will have a diminished experience.

I [wrote extensively about why the market won’t win](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/inside-the-invisible-war-for-the-open-internet-dd31a29a3f08), and was invited to talk on Net Neutrality at SXSW a few months ago.

Before you cheer on an “experiment”, consider the history of regulating telecommunication, and why it’s different from other industries.
