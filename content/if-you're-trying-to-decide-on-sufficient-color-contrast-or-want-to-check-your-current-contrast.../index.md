If you’re trying to decide on sufficient color contrast, or want to check your current contrast ration, use this [color contrast checker](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/#white-on-darkgreen) built by [Lea Verou](https://medium.com/u/f641207306c2).

When we redesigned Free Code Camp’s user interface in January, we originally used a lighter shade of green. Thankfully, designers from our community quickly pointed out that we could get a significantly higher color contrast (7.4) just by darkening the color almost imperceptibly.

We took this opportunity to switch to a named CSS color. So now if you ever want to color something “Free Code Camp green” all you need to do is use “color: darkgreen” and the element will become #006400.

Thanks for bringing up the color contrast issue. Forthose of you reading this, be sure to also check out @christianmiller
