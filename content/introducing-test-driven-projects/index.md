The best way to get better at coding is by practicing. And the best way to practice is to build projects.

Free Code Camp’s open source curriculum currently includes 25 projects. You start with a blank canvas — zero lines of code. Then you build up these projects based on nothing more than the a set of agile user stories — specifications.

These are like jumping off of a diving board into the deep end of a pool and hoping you’ll figure out how to swim. Most people adapt to them, and succeed. Our community members complete [dozens of these projects](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/c/project-feedback) each day. 

But it’s pretty rough. Sometimes it takes people weeks to build just one project, with nothing more than a set of requirements to guide them.

Well I’m pleased to announce that we now have something much better.

  

Well now, all those user stories will have a test behind it. And you will know for sure whether you’ve fulfilled it.

  

  

  

Of course, like everything we do, all this is out in the open.
