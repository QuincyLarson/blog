> “You don’t know the power of the Dark Side.” — Darth Vader

Today, I’m going to show you the power of the dark side. I’m going to show you how to take a helpful household appliance — the humble wifi router — and corrupt it for your own evil ends. 

I’m going to show you how to rob a bank with it.

Actually, we’ll need need more than one of these. We’ll need millions of them. But don’t worry — we can get them. I’ll show you how.

  

(Sure, the banks have insurance for these kinds of things, but hey, at least we’re making their collective insurance premiums go up. Which makes their costs go up. Which they pass on to us in the form of higher fees. D’oh.)

Hackers used these hacked home routers to launch massive distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks on Russian banks. 

  

### Harden your router against attacks

  

If you want to really batten down the hatches, Lucian Constantin has compiled a [comprehensive checklist](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3093385/security/how-to-secure-your-router-and-home-network.html) of security measures you should apply for your router.
