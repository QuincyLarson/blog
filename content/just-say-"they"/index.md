Male book author awkwardly shoe-horns a female pronoun into a description of a marginally important character

  

Dictionaries are now fine with the use of they as a singular pronoun.

Did you know that 

Unless a person’s gender is important to what you’re saying, just use “they”

Chinese they’re pronounced the same way.
