About a year ago, we launched our community forum. Today, thousands of campers use it each day to share insights and get help.

Here are some of the useful things you can do there:

1.  You can ask a question about anything. Then you can read other campers’ replies. If a reply answers your question, you can mark it as the solution.
2.  You can [get feedback on projects you’ve built](https://fcc.im/2qxH5PQ).
3.  You can [read about campers who’ve gotten their first developer job](https://fcc.im/2rsiP0U), and their coding journeys so far.

You can even see which campers have been most helpful each week on our [leaderboard](https://fcc.im/2qTi05a).

We have a powerful search engine and thousands of topics, so you can find discussions about pretty much everything on there.

If you already have a GitHub account, [it only takes a few seconds to join](https://fcc.im/2pVp3WU).

### Thought of the day:
