![‚ÄúOne does not simply walk into Mordor.‚Äù This is the image that made Sean Bean immortal. And it‚Äôs a good thing, too‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe dies in movies more than [any other modern¬†actor](http://nerdist.com/does-sean-bean-really-die-more-than-other-actors/).](./asset-1.jpeg)

One does not simply learn to code. Because coding isn‚Äôt easy. Coding is hard. Everyone knows that. Anyone who‚Äôs scoured a stack trace‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor git detached their head‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcan tell you that.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of marketers out there trying to cash in on the notion that ‚Äúcoding is easy!‚Äù Or that it will be, if you use their product.



When someone tells you that coding is easy, they are doing you a huge disservice. This can really only play out in one of three ways:

#### Scenario 1

**Person 1**: ‚ÄúI tried to learn to code once. I had a hard time. Life got in the way, and I am no longer trying to learn to code.‚Äù

**Marketer**: ‚ÄúCoding is easy!‚Äù

**Person 1**: ‚ÄúWhat? Oh. Maybe coding is easy after all. Maybe I‚Äôm just dumb.‚Äù

#### Scenario 2

**Person 2**: ‚ÄúI want to learn to code, but it sounds hard.‚Äù

**Marketer**: ‚ÄúCoding is easy!‚Äù

**Person 2**: ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

**Marketer**: ‚ÄúYes. Buy my course/program/e-book and you‚Äôll be an elite coder in less than a month.‚Äù

**Person 2**:

![Shut up and take my¬†money!](./asset-2.jpeg)

**Person 2, one month later**: ‚ÄúI thought coding was supposed to be easy. Maybe I‚Äôm just dumb.‚Äù

#### Scenario 3

**Person 3**: I have no interest in ever learning to code. I‚Äôm a successful manager. If I ever need something coded, I‚Äôll just pay someone to code it for me.

**Marketer**: Coding is easy!

**Person 3**: Oh, OK. Figures. In that case, I guess I won‚Äôt pay those code monkeys very much, or hold their work in very high regard.

### Brain surgery is¬†easy

Saying ‚ÄúCoding is easy!‚Äù is like saying ‚ÄúBrain surgery is easy!‚Äù Or saying ‚ÄúWriting novels is easy!‚Äù

> A brain surgeon at a dinner party says to novelist Margret Atwood: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted to write. When I retire and have the time, I‚Äôm going to be a¬†writer.‚Äù

> Margret Atwood replies: ‚ÄúWhat a coincidence, because when I retire, I‚Äôm going to be a brain surgeon.‚Äù

And yet, marketers continue to say: ‚ÄúCoding is easy!‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoding isn‚Äôt that hard!‚Äù, or my personal favorite, ‚ÄúCoding is easy! It‚Äôs the [something that makes coding hard] that‚Äôs hard!‚Äù

And all that these marketers achieve in saying this is to make people feel dumb‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsometimes taking their money in the process.

### The curse of knowledge

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not just marketers who say coding is easy. I meet experienced developers all the time who also say ‚Äúcoding is easy!‚Äù

Why would someone who‚Äôs gone through the thousands of hours it takes to get good at coding say that coding is easy? Because they‚Äôre suffering from a cognitive bias called the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). They cannot remember what it was like to not know how to code. And even if they can, they‚Äôve probably long forgotten how hard coding was for them at first.

The curse of knowledge prevents many experienced developers from being able to empathize with beginners. And nowhere is this lack of empathy more apparent than everyone‚Äôs favorite Google result: the coding tutorial.



How many times have you actually been able to finish a random tutorial you found through Google, without getting derailed by some cryptic error or ambiguity?

And the worst thing about this process is when tutorial authors unconsciously pepper their instructions with words like ‚Äúobviously‚Äù ‚Äúeasily‚Äù and most mocking of all: ‚Äúsimply.‚Äù

Nothing is more frustrating than being 30 minutes into a tutorial and getting stuck on a step that says ‚Äúsimply integrate with Salesforce‚Äôs API,‚Äù or ‚Äúsimply deploy to AWS.‚Äù

And when this happens, the voice of a thousand marketers echoes through your head: ‚ÄúCoding is easy!‚Äù

You‚Äôll remember those experienced developers you met a few weeks ago who tried their best to encourage you by saying: ‚ÄúCoding is easy!‚Äù

You‚Äôll even have flashbacks of all those bad Hollywood hacking scenes where they make coding look so easy.

Before you know it, you‚Äôll suddenly hear the sound of your own voice screaming, feel your body rising to its feet and (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

But it‚Äôs OK. Take a deep breath. Coding isn‚Äôt easy. Coding is hard. Everyone knows that.

![Coding in real life VS coding in the¬†movies](./asset-3.gif)

Still, you‚Äôll yearn for those l33+ h@x0r skills. You‚Äôll feel impelled to vanquish bugs with nothing but your wits‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand a gratuitous number of green-on-black monitors.

![](./asset-4.jpeg)

So let‚Äôs chase that dragon. Let‚Äôs be that elite Hollywood programmer. If only for a moment, let‚Äôs feel what that‚Äôs like.

Here we go:

Step 1: Turn out the lights, pop your collar, put on some aviator sunglasses

Step 2: Guzzle an energy drink, crush the can, and chuck it over your shoulder

Step 3: [Go here](http://hackertyper.net/) and bang on your keyboard as fast as humanly possible

Power fantasy fulfilled.

Do you feel better? Are you laughing at the absurdity of our collective construct of software development?

Now that we‚Äôve gotten that out of our system, let‚Äôs talk about the most insidious word in the English language.

### Nothing is ever¬†simple

There‚Äôs a good chance that if you encounter a word like ‚Äúsimply‚Äù in a tutorial, that tutorial will assume a lot about your prior knowledge.

Maybe the author assumes that you‚Äôve previously coded something similar and are just using their tutorial as a reference. Maybe the author wrote the tutorial with themselves in mind as their target audience.

Either way, there‚Äôs a good chance that the tutorial will not be designed for someone at your exact level of coding skills.

Hence the ‚Äúrule of simply‚Äù:

> Don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúsimply‚Äù in your tutorials, and don‚Äôt use tutorials that use the word ‚Äúsimply.‚Äù

Learn it. Know it. Live it.

Unfortunately, twenty minutes into a desperate Googling session, you are unlikely to remember that you should search the tutorial page to see whether its author presumptively uses words like ‚Äúsimply.‚Äù

Well, we‚Äôve got you covered. [Albert Meija](http://twitter.com/gs_febby) has created a Chrome extension that will detect the word ‚Äúsimply‚Äù in a tutorial and will pop up a notice that the tutorial isn‚Äôt designed for beginners.

[**Simply**  
_This extension will analyze a tutorial and determine if it's beginner friendly._chrome.google.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simply/dbkojggbamijkhapkmbgonfghcicedfm/ "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simply/dbkojggbamijkhapkmbgonfghcicedfm/")[](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simply/dbkojggbamijkhapkmbgonfghcicedfm/)

This Chrome Extension serves as a proverbial canary in the coal mine, notifying you of the presence of the word ‚Äúsimply‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand thus likely assumptions about your prior knowledge‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbefore you get too far into the tutorial.

Albert built this chrome extension in just a few hours, in response to a challenge I tweeted out. Here are some of the other entries from Free Code Camp campers, whose extensions do similar things:

[**Simply for Beginners?**  
_Highlights all instances of the word simply and will send a notification letting you know it's not for beginners._chrome.google.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simply-for-beginners/opopppnnlnbajijdclnnlmojldgkmpil "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simply-for-beginners/opopppnnlnbajijdclnnlmojldgkmpil")[](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simply-for-beginners/opopppnnlnbajijdclnnlmojldgkmpil)

[**Not So Simple**  
_Simple Chrome extension utilizing the "simply" rule. If a tutorial contains the word simply, it's probably not for‚Ä¶_chrome.google.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/not-so-simple/ajlkhboagakfehbjcdbaepgbhglkoipn "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/not-so-simple/ajlkhboagakfehbjcdbaepgbhglkoipn")[](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/not-so-simple/ajlkhboagakfehbjcdbaepgbhglkoipn)

[**not-so-simply**  
_Warns you if the page you are on contains the word 'simply'. Used to avoid programming tutorials that tend to not be so‚Ä¶_chrome.google.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/not-so-simply/ljlcdallmfkhhdoflmalffgbgahbefcn/related "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/not-so-simply/ljlcdallmfkhhdoflmalffgbgahbefcn/related")[](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/not-so-simply/ljlcdallmfkhhdoflmalffgbgahbefcn/related)

We could certainly take these chrome extensions further. Maybe use Natural Language Processing to produce a more accurate assessment of the relative difficulty of a given tutorial, or its ‚Äúpresumptive index.‚Äù

But in the meantime, this simple extension may steer you clear of those ship-sinking ‚Äúsimply‚Äù icebergs out there in the chilly ocean that is learning to code.

Until we meet again‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästay strong and don‚Äôt believe the hype. Learning to code is hard. Tune out the noise, stick with it, and profit.
