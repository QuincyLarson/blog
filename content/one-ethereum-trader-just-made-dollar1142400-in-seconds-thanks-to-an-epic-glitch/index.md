Yesterday, a market where people trade the Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency Ethereum crashed instantly.

The value of Ether (the Ethereum currency) plunged from about US $300 to $0.10 in seconds. Then it bouncing right back up to $300.

Here’s how this extremely unlikely event unfolded:

1.  Around 12:30 pm PST the price of Ether — which had been trading on the [GDAX currency exchange](https://fcc.im/2rYzca5) at around $300 — suddenly dropped to $0.10. The official explanation is that a trader placed a multi-million dollar order to sell Ether.
2.  In the chaos, computers sold off Ether in automated, price-triggered “sell” orders. Traders lost millions of dollars.
3.  But one trader had an automated “buy” order telling computers to buy 3,809 Ether if it ever dropped so low as $0.10.
4.  Within a few minutes, the price of Ether completely recovered to around $300. This meant that the 3,809 Ether the trader had just bought was now worth $1,142,700. The trader had made a 300,000% return within a few minutes.

We’ve had “flash crashes” like this before ([2010’s sudden Dow Jones price drop of 9%](https://fcc.im/2s3bPrl)). But nothing of this magnitude, where an asset lost 99.96% of its value in a matter of seconds.

And in case you’re wondering, no — GDAX is not issuing refunds or reversing any of these trades. Here’s their [official explanation of what happened](https://fcc.im/2tWFjII).

[_Update from GDAX_](https://blog.gdax.com/eth-usd-trading-update-2-216a3b946ef6)_: “We will establish a process to credit customer accounts which experienced a margin call or stop loss order executed on the GDAX ETH-USD order book as a direct result of the rapid price movement.”_

All this leaves some lingering mysteries:

-   Why did the price of ether crash so suddenly and so completely? Did someone intentionally manipulate the market with the multi-million dollar sell order?
-   Why didn’t GDAX have countermeasures in place to stop trading once the price started falling? If these countermeasures were indeed in place, did they fail to kick into effect?
-   Did the person behind this extremely profitable trade create the $0.10 buy order as part of some broader strategy of exploiting extremely unlikely [black swan](https://fcc.im/2t2WXO7) events? Or did they just create it as a practical joke, never expecting for the price of Ether to drop that low?
-   Who were they? Did the same person place both the multi-million dollar sell order and the buy order at $0.10 knowing it would crash the system? Since the holders of Ethereum “smart contracts” are anonymous, we may never know.
