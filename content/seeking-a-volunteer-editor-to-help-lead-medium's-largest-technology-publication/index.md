freeCodeCamp is now the largest technology publication on Medium. And as its sole editor, I get way more high-quality story submissions than I have time to edit and publish.

This means that Iâ€™m the biggest bottleneckâ€Šâ€”â€Šbetween all the developers, designers, and data scientists writing these amazing storiesâ€Šâ€”â€Šand a growing audience thatâ€™s eager to read them.

Even though freeCodeCamp.org reaches millions of people each month through Medium, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp), and our [coding platform](https://www.freecodecamp.org), weâ€™re a small [donor-supported nonprofit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate/). We lack the resources to hire professional editors.

This said, a lack of resources hasnâ€™t stopped us in other areas. We have thousands of volunteers running local study groups, contributing to open source projects, and moderating forums and chatrooms.

If you have experience editing a newspaper, academic journal, magazine, or blog, and are able to contribute a few hours of your time each week to this publication, we should talk. ðŸ˜Š [Read our publication guide](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-published-in-the-freecodecamp-medium-publication-9b342a22400e), then reach out to me.

Youâ€™ll learn a ton about technology in the process, and help a community that has published 1,000+ free (and ad-free) articles. And together, weâ€™ll be able to maintain our current high standards while publishing a lot more stories for everyone to read.
