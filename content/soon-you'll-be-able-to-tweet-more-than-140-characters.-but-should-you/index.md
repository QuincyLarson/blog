Twitter’s boomerang CEO Jack Dorsey is trying to revitalize Twitter with features like Polls and Moments.

He’s doing this because Twitter’s growth has stagnated.

![Source: [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/12087357/Removing-Twitters-140-character-limit-is-Jack-Dorseys-biggest-gamble-yet.html)](./asset-2.png)

Now he’s making his most dramatic change yet — removing Twitter’s famous 140 character limit.

Many people (who haven’t yet embraced Twitter as a real-time communication tool) would say that this character limit is the very thing that differentiates Twitter from Facebook.

Here’s Jack Dorsey’s 1,315 character tweet announcing the change:



You might think that Twitter’s constraint of having to speak your mind in 140 characters or less would lead to a dumbing-down of communication. Actually, [the opposite happens](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/10/twitter-language-book_n_5786556.html). We have terser, more witty prose.

By removing this restriction, Twitter may end up diluting the quality of any given tweet.

> Twitter actually may be improving its users’ writing, as it forces them to wring meaning from fewer letters — it embodies William Strunk’s famous dictum, Omit needless words, at the keystroke level.

Instead of allowing longer tweets, they might be better off forcing us to be even more concise.

Buffer did a study that found the optimal length of a tweet is actually closer to 100 characters. That’s right — tweets that are shorter than 100 characters [get 17% more engagement](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/files/2014/10/ideal-length-social-media.jpg) than tweets longer than 100 characters.

It remains to be seen how many characters we’ll be able to tweet in the future. But judging by Jack Dorsey’s tweet, it will be significantly more than 140 characters.

This raises a lot of questions:

-   Will your Twitter feed soon be peppered with long-winded essays?
-   Or will they collapse longer tweets with a “read more” button?
-   Will such a “read more” button turn tweeting into an exercise in composing clickbait headlines?
-   And more importantly, will anyone be interested in reading all these extra characters?

I decided to use one of Twitter’s new features for the first time and find out.

If you’ll indulge me:
