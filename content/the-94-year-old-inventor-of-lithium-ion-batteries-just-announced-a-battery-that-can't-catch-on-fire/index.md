Here are three links worth your time:

1.  University of Texas professor John Goodenough (an ironic name for an inventor) lead a team to develop the next generation of batteries that charge 3 times faster and won’t catch on fire no matter how badly you abuse them ([3 minute read](http://bit.ly/2m3Fijh))
2.  How much should you charge for your Software-as-a-Service tool? I analyzed prices from 1,530 products to find out ([4 minute read](http://bit.ly/2mBhBlC))
3.  Before you bury yourself in packages, learn the Node.js runtime itself ([9 minute read](http://bit.ly/2lDFCUj))

Bonus: Beau explains how you can get your web app to show your users desktop notifications using JavaScript ([4 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2ln7wZh))
