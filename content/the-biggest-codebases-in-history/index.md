Here’s a diagram of the biggest codebases in history, as measured by lines of code:

As you can see, Google has by far the largest codebase of all. And all 2 billion lines of code fits into a single code repository.

But it isn’t a Git repository. Google [uses its own version control system](https://fcc.im/2rRzwDZ), which was designed specifically for its 62,000 employees (about 1/3 of whom are developers) to collaborate efficiently.

The distinction of “largest Git repository” goes to Microsoft, who announced today that their Windows Git repository has:

-   approximately 3.5M files that
-   results in a Git repo of about 300 gigabytes in size
-   with 4,000 engineers producing 1,760 daily “lab builds” across 440 branches, plus thousands of pull request validation builds.
