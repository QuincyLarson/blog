About one year ago, we shut down our open source community‚Äôs blog and moved everyone over to Medium.

Since then, on this Medium publication,

-   **214 contributors**
-   have published **460 stories**
-   which have each been viewed an **average of 17,000 times**.

![Our community‚Äôs publication now gets more than a million views per¬†month.](./asset-2.png)

Half of all the stories we‚Äôve published have been viewed at least 5,000 times.

![An average of nearly 27,000 people visit our community‚Äôs Medium publication every¬†day.](./asset-3.png)

Over 12 months, our community publication‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich focuses on development, design, and data science‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähas become the [12th largest Medium publication](https://toppub.xyz/), and the largest technical one.

![Readers spent more than 7 million minutes reading our publication over the past 3¬†months.](./asset-4.png)

How did our community‚Äôs publication manage to grow so quickly?

### Reason #1: Deep thinkers who are good at¬†writing
