> “_The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” — William Gibson_

This week, Bill Gates suggested that we implement a “robot tax”.

And Elon Musk said that Universal Basic Income is necessary.

The future is already here. We can see traces of it. 

Anyone who’s read a science fiction novel or watched an episode of Star Trek knows what’s going to happen. 

1.  Automation (basically, better software) will help individual human workers produce more goods and services.
2.  As human workers become more and more productive, the price of goods and services fall, until they are practically free.
3.  But since we’ll need fewer and fewer human workers, we’ll have more unemployed people. So even though everything will continue to get cheaper, this won’t happen fast enough. And a whole lot of people will suffer.

Most people accept that this is going to happen. Most scientists, economists, historians — and even politicians — realize that it’s inevitable.

The problem is that most people haven’t stopped to think about it.

The reality is most people are just too busy to stop and think about this. And I don’t blame them — it’s hard to think about.

### Universal Basic Income

  

  

Programming isn’t just another job. It’s the last job.

By definition, the last job that will be automated is the job of doing the automating itself.
