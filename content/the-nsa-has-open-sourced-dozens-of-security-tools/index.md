If you’re a tax-paying American, you may wonder what the shadowy National Security Agency (NSA) is doing with your money.

Well, aside from [stockpiling vulnerabilities in old versions of Windows](https://fcc.im/2sszV0u), and [writing viruses that destroy nuclear centrifuges](https://fcc.im/2siu0N0), the NSA [builds and open-sources](https://fcc.im/2tkWfJA) some pretty cool tech:

-   [goSecure](https://fcc.im/2sHH0fT) — a portable Virtual Private Network (VPN) system built with Linux and a Raspberry Pi
-   [Secure-Host-Baseline](https://fcc.im/2sKMRBN) — a guide for configuring Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 to Department of Defense “Secure Host Baseline” standards
-   [WALKOFF](https://fcc.im/2sPeARt) — an active cyber defense development framework enabling you to write and deploy code across WALKOFF-enabled orchestration tools

You can browse the NSA’s open source projects — and the projects of its defensive Information Assurance division — [here](https://fcc.im/2tkWfJA).
