The first Saturday of every month, our open source community hosts an interactive live stream on our [YouTube](http://YouTube.com/freecodecamp) called a ‚ÄúSummit.‚Äù

> Summit  
> /Ààs…ôm…ôt/¬†  
> Noun  
> 1\. the highest point of a hill or mountain.  
> 2\. a conference of high-level officials

Each summit, different members of our open source community‚Äôs core team hop onto a call together. We demo new features and new coding challenges. Campers (our students) join us to showcase projects they‚Äôve built pro-bono for nonprofits.

Each month is essentially an agile sprint, with each summit serving as its ‚Äúdemo day.‚Äù Hundreds of campers tune in so they can comment on our progress and ask questions.

If you haven‚Äôt attended a summit before and are curious what they‚Äôre like, we‚Äôve archived previous ones [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkX5F_g4YHi4vQMtOO4yPV0).

#### Hills we‚Äôve¬†climbed

In December 2015, dozens of volunteers pulled together to help us expand Free Code Camp‚Äôs challenges into a [full 2,080-hour, four-certificate curriculum](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learn-to-code-by-coding-d1e241de81c0).

Next, we started off 2016 with a [redesign of our website](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/tinkering-toward-simplicity-6a15fb9dcdcb).

Then in February, we optimized some queries to [relieve our overloaded servers](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-flood-of-data-714f287d75a0).

We‚Äôve fixed a few major bottle-necks in infrastructure, and improved our website‚Äôs usability and aesthetics. Now we can return to ‚Äúcamper-driven development‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbuilding the challenges and features that are most-requested within our community.

And this time, we‚Äôre trying something we‚Äôve never done before: setting concrete goals more than one summit in advance.

#### Leaving the safety of our¬†basecamp

Judging by the the steady influx of [tweets](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=freecodecamp&src=typd), emails, and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/issues) from our community, it‚Äôs clear that:

-   we need to expand our wiki articles and 2-minute video challenges to cover a broader array of technology topics.
-   campers want to build our complicated front end and data visualization projects **right there on our website.** **Collaboratively. And in real time.**

With all this in mind, we drafted our goals for our next four summits.

#### March 2016¬†Summit

-   600 wiki articles are live
-   Spanish-language challenges and challenge map are live
-   First Spanish-language wiki article is live
-   Free Code Camp‚Äôs challenge engine is a single-page app (using React/Redux)

#### April 2016¬†Summit

-   800 wiki articles are live
-   60 video challenges are live
-   Global hotkeys and code editor hotkeys are live, and can be toggled on and off.

-   Audit of NodeSchool.io modules is complete (and we have stable forks)
-   Data Visualization challenges for React, Redux, Sass, and D3 are live. (These are optional, and currently most campers just use each tool‚Äôs official documentation to build our data visualization projects.)
-   GitHub Portfolio Export tool is live. (This will make it easier to export your challenge solutions to a GitHub repository.)
-   Live collaborative in-browser coding, with built-in VOIP support

#### June 2016¬†Summit

-   2,000 wiki articles are live
-   150 video challenges are live

If this all seems laughably ambitious, keep this in mind: we are a volunteer-driven community that is building a tool that helps you learn to code at your own pace, from anywhere, for free. **Everything we‚Äôve accomplished so far has been laughably ambitious.**

We can do this. In our open source community‚Äôs 16-month history, we‚Äôve risen to plenty of other challenges. And we will rise to these challenges.

But we‚Äôll need help‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand not just from experience JavaScript developers. You can aid us in our mission in a number of ways.

[Take this 2-minute quiz](https://www.qzzr.com/c/quiz/175881/free-code-camp-volunteer-quiz). It will guide you in deciding how you can best help our team of 400+ contributors meet these audacious goals. And it will refer you to a goal-specific chat room, where you can meet with other contributors.

Thanks for joining us on this epic climb. Hope to see you there at these upcoming summits!
