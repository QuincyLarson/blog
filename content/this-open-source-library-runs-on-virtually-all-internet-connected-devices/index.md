Here are three links worth your time:

1.  The open source cURL library just turned 19. It’s grown from a single developer to 1,500 contributors, 150,000 lines of code, and running on virtually every internet-connected device on Earth ([2 minute read](http://bit.ly/2ng6pr6))
2.  Nothing will change until you start building. ([5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2o35wpO))
3.  How Machines Make Sense of Big Data: an Introduction to Clustering Algorithms ([18 minute read](http://bit.ly/2odPyGE))

Bonus: Help us build a massive public dataset about people who are new to coding ([5 minute survey](http://bit.ly/2017-new-coder-survey))
