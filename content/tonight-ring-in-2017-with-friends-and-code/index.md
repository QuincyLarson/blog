Our community has grown a lot over the past year.

![](./asset-2.png)

Together, we completed millions of coding challenges, and created dozens of projects for nonprofits.

Thousands of us got developer jobs.

And more than 500 people have already committed to the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.fr40is5ix) in 2017.

Join them, and join us tonight.

Starting at 11 pm EST, we’ll welcome guests like Stack Overflow creator Jeff Atwood to our interactive live stream.
