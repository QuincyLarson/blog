### First, let’s establish what freeCodeCamp is. 

freeCodeCamp is:

-   A community of more than 1 million people who are learning to code
-   with study groups in 1,800 cities around the world
-   with a variety of open source projects — including the [freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) learning platform
-   all organized by [a small, donor-supported nonprofit](https://www.freecodecamp.com/donate)

Together, our community runs: 

-   Medium’s most widely-read publication
-   one of the largest technical YouTube channels
-   one of the biggest chat room system
-   and one of the largest online forums for programmers

  

### To raise awareness of all the incredible free learning resources on the internet.

  

We can’t rely on universities and corporations alone to help people learn. We need bold initiatives.

  

  

### To ourselves be an incredible free learning resource.

  

### To give independent developers a platform for share their insights and projects.

  

### To counter all the misinformation and marketing out there.

  

  

### Once common misconception about our open source community is that we’re competing with other resources.

We are competing with Netflix and League of Legends. We’re competing with things you can do in your scarce time that aren’t learning to code and working toward your first developer job.
